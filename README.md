# Cerbo

Cerbo (Pronounce /t͡serbo/) is a CMS/CMF to easily create and extends
web sites.

## ToDo

* Content structures
    * A structure could inherit from another one. This way you could
        have very generic elements that are used to handle while
        adding new elements for specific cases. (It allows too create
        generic templates that extends others too easily).
    * Structures are dynamic and can be made of different datatypes
        (the datatypes are defined in the kernel and in dedicated
        extensions).
